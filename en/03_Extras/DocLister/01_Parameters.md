Default value - none.

###orderBy

A single sort string (at least a collection of sortBy and sortDir parameters, but has a higher priority).

Possible values - any string that meets the rules for constructing the ORDER BY parameter in the SQL query. When sorting in the site_content controller, it is advisable to use the prefix c. for the fields of table site_content. The names of TV are indicated as is.

For sorting in random order, the value of the orderBy parameter will be "RAND()".

Default value - id DESC (or defined in the controller)

###sortBy

Sorting criterion without sorting direction.

Possible values - any string that meets the rules for constructing the ORDER BY parameter in the SQL query. The names of TV are indicated as is.

###tvSortWithDefault

Due to the engine features (TV whose values coincide with the default values are not saved in a separate table), sorting records may not be corrected if the Default value is different from the empty page.
Therefore, it is recommended to specify the TV parameters for which the Default value is forcibly specified.

##Filtering

###showNoPublish

Output of deleted or unpublished resources (used only in controllers based on site_content)

Possible values - 0/1.

Default value - 0

###filters 

Rules for filtering documents.

So, c DocLister you will never get a situation that documents published without deferred publication will always be at the end of the list.

Default value - pub_date.

###dateFormat

Formatting rules for the PHP function strftime.

The date source is the dateSource parameter. In addition, the date offset on the server is taken into account (see the system parameter server_offset_time). Thus, you can use a personalized time substitution depending on the user's time zone.
