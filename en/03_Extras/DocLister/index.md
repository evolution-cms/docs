Snippet for displaying information from various tables. It was originally developed as a replacement for the Ditto, but in the end it significantly surpassed it in its capabilities, flexibility and performance. In simple cases, using DocLister is not more difficult than Ditto (many parameters are the same).

Features:

* Extends easily;
* Allows to output data from any tables (including from the Shopkeeper directory);
* It is possible to output data in JSON-format;
* Ability to arbitrarily process data before output;
* Convenient debugging;
* Sorting by TV with type conversion;
* filtering of documents, including TV;
* Support for lexicons;
* Using settings from files.

DocLister requires PHP 5.3 or higher.
