## Overview
DLSitemap is a snippet to build XML site map for search engines and robots. It's much faster than [sitemap](https://github.com/extras-evolution/sitemap/) and can define priority and change frequency by the time of the last document modification.

The snippet itself is a wrapper for DocLister to run it with predefined parameters (see assets/snippets/DocLister/config/core/sitemap.json), so you can use all DocLister parameters to filter docs, change order and so on. But "prepare" parameter is filled with DLSitemap, so use "BeforePrepare" и "AfterPrepare" parameters instead of it.

If you want to control priority and change frequency manually, then you have to create TV-parameters named sitemap_priority and sitemap_changefreq (these names can be changed with priority и changefreq parameters). If document has no these TV-parameters, then priority and change frequency are defined automatically.
